## 📊 Data Understanding & Exploration

### Dataset Characteristics
```
Dataset shape: (4999, 6)
Features: transcription, description, medical_specialty, sample_name, keywords
Target classes: 40 medical specialties
Text length range: 11-18,425 characters
Missing data: 0.7% transcriptions, 21.4% keywords
```

### Key Findings from EDA
- **Severe class imbalance**: Top 12 classes contain 78.5% of data, bottom 11 classes only 2.5%
- **Text quality issues**: 2.5% non-ASCII characters, extreme length variations
- **Domain characteristics**: Rich medical vocabulary, structured report formats
- **High dimensionality potential**: 5,000+ unique medical terms identified

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Quality Assurance

### Cleaning Strategy
```python
# Missing Data Handling
- Removed 33 rows with missing transcriptions (0.7%)
- Dropped keywords column (21.4% missing - too sparse)
- Applied text quality filtering (removed <50 character texts)

# Outlier Management  
- Capped text length at 8,000 characters using IQR analysis
- Normalized non-ASCII characters with medical symbol preservation
- Applied conservative cleaning to preserve domain terminology
```

### Class Complexity Reduction
```python
# Strategic Class Consolidation
Original classes: 40
Final classes: 16 (top 15 + "Other")
Data retention: 98.9% (4,943/4,999 samples)
```

**Impact**: Improved model stability while maintaining business value (85% of documents get specific classification).

## 🔧 Feature Engineering

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
# Artifact-Aware Preprocessing
- Analyzed actual text patterns before transformation
- Preserved medical abbreviations (p.o. → oral, i.v. → intravenous)  
- Removed date/time artifacts while keeping medical terminology
- Created combined text from transcription + description
```

### Feature Creation Strategy
```python
# Multi-Modal Feature Engineering
1. TF-IDF Features (primary): 5,000 features
   - Unigrams + bigrams, medical-optimized parameters
   - min_df=2, max_df=0.95, stop_words='english'
   
2. Text Statistics: 6 features
   - Character/word counts, length ratios, category features
   
3. Categorical Encoding: 5 features  
   - Sample name encoding, medical structure indicators

Final feature matrix: (4,943 × 5,011)
```

## 📈 Feature Analysis & Selection

### Comprehensive Feature Importance Analysis
```python
# Multiple Validation Methods
Method 1: Statistical (F-score, Mutual Information)
Method 2: Model-based (Random Forest importance)  
Method 3: Variance analysis (low-variance feature detection)

Results:
- F-score/MI agreement: 73%
- Top features: medical terminology (discharge, procedure, history)
- Low variance features: 5,001/5,011 (99.8%)
```

### Key Insights
- **TF-IDF dominance**: 97.7% of predictive importance
- **Medical vocabulary**: Specialty-specific terms highly discriminative
- **Optimal feature count**: 400-600 features (validated through grid search)
- **Correlation patterns**: Expected medical n-gram relationships
