# 🚀 Production ML Model Deployment Strategy

This document explains how our ML system handles model deployment across different environments.

## ⚡ **Quick Start: Testing Before Model Upload**

**Good news!** The CI/CD pipeline works **immediately** even before you upload real models to cloud storage:

### **How CI/CD Testing Works**
```
1. 🧪 CI/CD Environment Detected (GITHUB_ACTIONS=true)
2. 📝 Creates dummy text files for Docker build
3. 🐳 Docker build succeeds with dummy files  
4. 🤖 Application creates MOCK models automatically
5. ✅ Health check passes, prediction endpoint works with mock data
6. 🚀 All tests pass!
```

### **What Happens in Each Environment**
| Environment | Model Source | Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **CI/CD Testing** | Mock objects | Health ✅, Predictions work with mock data |
| **Local Dev** | Real `data/*.pkl` files | Full functionality with real models |
| **Production** | Download from GCS | Full functionality with real models |

**So you can commit and test the pipeline RIGHT NOW!** 🎉

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Problem**: Models in CI/CD vs Production
- **CI/CD Testing**: Needs to build/test Docker containers but doesn't have real trained models
- **Production**: Needs real trained models for actual predictions
- **Challenge**: How to handle both scenarios without breaking the pipeline?

### **Solution**: Cloud Storage + Smart Loading
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Local Dev     │    │   CI/CD Testing  │    │   Production    │

└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## 📁 **Model Storage Strategy**

### **Local Development**
```bash
data/
├── optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl    # Real trained model
└── feature_engine.pkl              # Real feature engine
```

### **Cloud Storage (Production)**
```bash
gs://voize-ml-models/
└── models/
    ├── optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl
    └── feature_engine.pkl
```

### **CI/CD Testing**
```bash
data/
├── optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl    # Dummy content for Docker build
└── feature_engine.pkl              # Dummy content for Docker build
```

## 🔄 **Model Loading Flow**

The application uses intelligent model loading:

```python
def download_models_from_cloud():
    # 1. Check if models exist locally → Use them
    # 2. Check if CI/CD environment → Use dummy models for testing
    # 3. Try to download from GCS → Production models
    # 4. Fallback → Log error and handle gracefully
```

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Upload Models to Cloud Storage**

First, train your models locally, then upload them:

```bash
# Ensure you have real trained models
ls -la data/
# Should show: optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl, feature_engine.pkl

# Create GCS bucket (if not exists)
gsutil mb gs://voize-ml-models

# Upload models to cloud storage
python scripts/upload-models-to-gcs.py --bucket voize-ml-models --project your-gcp-project
```

### **2. Configure Production Environment**

Set these environment variables in production:

```bash
export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project"
export GCS_MODEL_BUCKET="voize-ml-models"
```

### **3. Verify Production Deployment**

Check the application logs during startup:

```bash
# Should see:
☁️  Downloading models from gs://voize-ml-models/
✅ Downloaded data/optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl
✅ Downloaded data/feature_engine.pkl
🎉 All models downloaded successfully from cloud storage
```

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# 1. Create dummy models for Docker build testing
- name: Create dummy model files for CI/CD testing
  run: |
    mkdir -p data
    echo "dummy_model_content" > data/optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl
    echo "dummy_feature_engine_content" > data/feature_engine.pkl

# 2. Build Docker image (works with dummy models)
# 3. Test endpoints (health check passes even without real models)
```

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Test with real models
python -m uvicorn src.inference.api:app --reload

# Test without models (simulates cloud download)
mv data/ data_backup/
python -m uvicorn src.inference.api:app --reload
# Should attempt cloud download
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Options**

### **Environment Variables**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID` | None | GCP project for cloud storage |
| `GCS_MODEL_BUCKET` | `voize-ml-models` | GCS bucket containing models |
| `CI` / `GITHUB_ACTIONS` | None | Auto-detected CI/CD environment |

### **Model Paths**

| Environment | Model Source | Fallback |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Local Dev | `data/*.pkl` | Train models locally |
| CI/CD | Dummy files | Continue with testing |
| Production | Download from GCS | Health check fails gracefully |

## 🚨 **Error Handling**

The system handles various failure scenarios:

```python
# Scenario 1: Models not found locally or in cloud
→ Health check returns 503 (unhealthy)
→ Prediction endpoint returns 503 (model not loaded)
→ Logs clear error messages for debugging

# Scenario 2: Cloud storage unavailable
→ Tries local files as fallback
→ Logs warning and continues

# Scenario 3: Invalid/corrupted models
→ Model loading fails with clear error
→ System remains responsive for health checks
```

## 📊 **Monitoring**

Monitor model loading status via endpoints:

```bash
# Check if models loaded successfully
curl https://your-api.com/health

# Response includes:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "model_loaded": true,
  "feature_engine_loaded": true,
  "load_status": {
    "completed": true,
    "load_duration": 2.34,
    "error": null
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Model Updates**

To update models in production:

```bash
# 1. Train new models locally
python src/training/train_model.py

# 2. Upload new models to cloud storage
python scripts/upload-models-to-gcs.py --bucket voize-ml-models

# 3. Restart production instances (they'll download new models)
# OR trigger a rolling update in Cloud Run
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Version Control**: Include model version in filenames
2. **Backup**: Keep previous model versions in cloud storage
3. **Validation**: Test new models before uploading to production bucket
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for model loading failures
5. **Rollback**: Have a process to quickly revert to previous models

## 📋 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Docker build fails | Missing model files | Use dummy files for CI/CD |
| Production 503 errors | Cloud download failed | Check GCS permissions |
| Slow startup | Large model files | Optimize model size or use model compression |
| Memory issues | Models too large | Use streaming download or model quantization |

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check if models exist in cloud storage
gsutil ls gs://voize-ml-models/models/

# Test cloud download locally
python -c "from src.inference.api import download_models_from_cloud; download_models_from_cloud()"

# Verify model file integrity
python -c "import pickle; model = pickle.load(open('data/optimized_multinomial_nb.pkl', 'rb')); print(type(model))"
```

This approach gives us a **production-ready ML deployment strategy** that handles all environments appropriately! 🎉
